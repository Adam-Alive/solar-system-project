# Solar System Cruises

The reader is asked to fast-forward to the year 2125 and imagine that space tourism is as commonplace as air travel and ocean cruises are today.

This website markets the travel services of Solar System Cruises, the leading provider of third-wave space tourism. The site targets mid to high-end consumers who wish to take the trip of a lifetime across all or parts of the solar system. After a brief introduction to the company, users can read about three cruise packages, the company's space fleet and departure locations, all with supporting images. They can choose from three price levels, with a summary of the benefits of each, and submit a booking form with their preferences.
