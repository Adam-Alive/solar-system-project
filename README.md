# Solar System Cruises

The reader is asked to fast-forward to the year 2125 and imagine that space tourism is now as accessible as air travel and sea cruises are today.

This website promotes and sells the travel services of Solar System Cruises, the leading provider of third-wave space tourism. The site targets mid to high-end consumers who wish to take the trip of a lifetime across parts or all of our solar system. After reading a brief introduction to the company, visitors are given details about three cruise packages, the company's space fleet and departure locations, all with supporting images. They can then choose from three price levels, with a summary of the benefits of each and then submit a booking form with their preferences.
